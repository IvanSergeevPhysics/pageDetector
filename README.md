# pageDetector

This is a telegram bot for document segmentation on the image.

In this project, the MobileNetv3 neural network was used to obtain the document mask on the original image. The model was trained on an artificially generated dataset.

After obtaining the document mask, post-processing was performed to transform the document to the size of the original image. This algorithm is implemented in the extractPage.py.

The aiogram framework was used to interact with the Telegram Bot API.
